# Rubicon!

### A Simple Game Tracker
From organizing a your personal games library to organizing a weekend games conference, Rubicon! has you covered.  Or it will, anyhow: this is VERY MUCH in development.  Feel free to send in a PR if you want to pitch in.

#### Planned Functionality
1. Plan everything from a small game night with friends to a multi-day, multi-group marathon
9. Support both tabletop groups and LAN parties
1. Track play-time of games, including multiple rounds of the same game
3. Track and organize your own games library
5. A dashboard that shows your library, favorite games, and bestest besties
2. Use [flaskbb](https://github.com/flaskbb/flaskbb) for communication, be it planning, logistics, rants, or trash talk


I plan to deploy this to a free Heroku instance and keep it up there, so feel free to use it for more than just Rubicon IV: Wrath of Con
